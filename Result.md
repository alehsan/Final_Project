After  performing   data preparation process which include data cleaning, merging and  creating   new variables for indicating extreme weather, visualization  and dropping unnecessary rows from cityline dataset, I could find that on average it takes more than two days and 12 hours to address a sewer back up  complaint  and totally about 12021 complaints  recorded about sewer back up problem by Department of  Public Work(DPW) in each year that make this study worthy. By grouping  the data and visualizing through scatter plot, it turned out that the zip code 13205 recoded  the highest number of sewer back up complaints which is 3342, and the zip code 13215 recorded the lowest number of sewer back up problem which is about 13 complaints.


 Interestingly, I could find  positive  correlation between the completion time of request for sewer back up service (total_days) and extreme weather variables.  Therefore, we can make inference that the  extreme weather in Syracuse city  delay the time to address a complaint about fixing sewer back up problem.
