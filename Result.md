After  performing   data preparation process which include data cleaning, merging and  creating   new variables for indicating extreme weather and dropping other type of complaint from cityline dataset, I could find that on average it takes more than two days and 12 hours to address a sewer back up  complaint  and totally about 12021 complaints  recorded about sewer back up problem by Department of  Public Work(DPW) in each year that make this study worthy.


 Interestingly, I could find  positive  correlation between the completion time of request for sewer back up service (total_days) and extreme weather variables.  Therefore, we can make inference that the  extreme weather in Syracuse city  delay the time to address a complaint for fixing sewer back up problem.
